# Command Mobile Penetration Testing Cheatsheet for iOS

**Caution** : The iOS application has a different environment than the Android application, some commands here only work with MacOS.

## Preparation
**Install Brew**, Open terminal (Finder -> Application -> Utilities -> Terminal) and run this command :</br>
`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`</br></br>
**Install XCode**, Open terminal and run this command : </br>
`$ xcode-select --install`</br>
Or you can download manualy on [Apple Website](https://developer.apple.com/downloads)</br></br>

Regist your Apple ID as [Apple Developer Account](http://developer.apple.com/account). You don't need to pay as Apple Developer Program on this section just register your account as a developer, because we just need to get a Certificate for signing the ipa file on XCode or other tools.

## Running idevicedebug.exe on windows

Need this file `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg` & `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg.signature` 
(From xcode folder install on mac `/XCode/Contents/Developer/Platforms/IPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/<iOS_version_number>/`)

- mount the developerdiskimage: ./ideviceimagemounter.exe "./DeveloperDiskImage.dmg"
- debug the apps : ./idevicedebug.exe -d run vantagepoint.id.Hook2

## Signing IPA File with Our Provisioning Profile

This tool is very helpfull :) [iOS App Signer](https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/) is GUI based. 
To generate our provisioning profile you can do it on XCODE while install the application.

### Troubleshoot
- if you get error message like this ``` If you have previously trusted your certificate using Keychain, please set the Trust setting back to the system default ``` 
- Don't Panic ! 
- Do this step: 
 1. Go into Xcode and delete your account from Preferences
 2. Go to ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles in finder and delete the files within
 3. Go into keychain and delete any personal certificates mentioning Mac Developer, iOS Developer, etc
 4. Add your account back into Xcode and choose to revoke the existing certificate (If you can't revoke, leave it)
 5. Go to xcode, and try to install dummy application into device. This step will trigger apple to generate new our certificate.
 6. And then, Open iOS App Signer
